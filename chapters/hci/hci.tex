\section{What is an interaction?}
\label{sec:what_is_an_interaction}

\todo[inline]{here talk about the very elementary properties of what is actually an interaction in general. for examples, use HHI (HCI has its own section).}

\section{Interacting with computers}
\label{sec:interacting_with_computers}

\todo[inline]{here talk about how the general definition from previous chapter can be applied for computers. specifically, go over interfaces and methods for interacting with machines and computers is specific (there was a thesis/long paper about that somewhere). can even give the example of this calculation of best button for mouse pointing, which is an example of how computer interfaces should be treated differently from other interactions.}
