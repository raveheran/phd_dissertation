%\subsection{Conversation-level accommodation behavior}
%\label{subsec:conversation-level_accommodation_behavior}

Conversations are complex processes that require some expertise and some quantitative analysis to detect and isolate specific patterns in them.
All the more so, since effects may have long, non-linear relations.
A behavior is a complex collection of conducts of a person (and any organism, system, or artificial entity), particularly those towards a certain environment.
The realization of one's behavior over the course of a conversation can communicate information regarding one's state and goals, especially with this deviates from the individual's expected behavior.
The behavior leads to reactions to environmental input and can be modified due to reinforcements from the environment or self-directed motives.
These modifications can occur over time quickly or slowly, consciously or unconsciously, and to greater or lesser extends, which makes them dynamic and thus cannot be defined discretely.
All the above is true also for vocal behaviors, which are expressed in spoken interactions.
Specifically, vocal accommodation reflects dynamic changes during conversation that can be affected by the external speech input of other interlocutors.
It can therefore be beneficial to \textbf{move away from value comparisons in favor of behavior descriptors} to depict an interaction.
This is done by analyzing spoken interactions as entire events with a continuous temporal dimensions as opposed to a comparison between some discrete points in time.
Examining the whole conversation can help, for example, to determine who was leading the changes or when more accommodation occurred.
In this work, such analyses were utilized in \cref{chap:conv_analysis} to determine the leading speaker in each conversation and in \cref{chap:speech_variations_in_hhci} to expose the ongoing changes in the human speaker's productions.

The way speakers accommodate to each other is very unlikely to be linear from beginning to end and can change throughout the conversation.
Therefore, comparing the differences between two discrete, distant points in time might miss or oversimplify some dynamics that occurred between them.
Moreover, comparisons like that must inherently take the view of one speaker instead of looking at the conversation as a complete entity.
Quantitative analyses often leave accommodation hidden or overly-simplified if analyzing a conversation on turn-by-turn basis or by splitting it arbitrarily into two or more parts (often equally-long, non-overlapping time intervals) and directly comparing them using raw values as in \citet{Heldner2010pitch, Rahimi2018weighting, Ibrahim2019fundamental}.
\citet[][p.~15]{DeLooze2014investigating} points out that in these cases it is assumed that accommodation is a strictly local phenomenon where a speaker's utterances is linked exclusively to the other interlocutor's immediate preceding utterance.
Such analyses result in a linear, static representation of the conversation's evolution, from which generalized conclusion are hard to draw.
They might even be inaccurate or misleading, especially when both speakers change their output over time, as demonstrated by \citet{CohenPriva2019limitations}.
That work specifically refer to \ac{did} measurements, where pairs of two discrete points in time are compared to measure accommodation between speakers using the following distance formula\footnote{Note that this way of measuring \ac{did} is commutative and therefore doesn't measure the changes from the view of a specific speaker \citep[unlike,~e.g.,][p.~3]{CohenPriva2019limitations}.}
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:did}
	DiD_{\vec{i},\vec{s}} \coloneqq \sqrt{(\vec{i}_{t + 1}^n - \vec{s}_{t + 1}^n)^2 + (\vec{i}_t^n - \vec{s}_t^n)^2} \equiv \lVert \vec{i} - \vec{s} \rVert_n.
\end{equation}
\eqname{\Acl{did} measure (simplified)}
\noindent
%
\cref{fig:accommodation_types} shows the interaction between two speakers' productions in a hypothetical conversation.
By merely looking at the plot, it is clear that the two speakers do not sustain the same behavior throughout the conversation.
For example, between marks A and B the orange speaker's values go remarkably downwards (though not linearly), while the green speaker remains roughly stable -- i.e., \emph{divergence} (although this can also be seen as an independent changes).
Subsequently, between B and C the distance is generally maintained.
Between C and D \emph{convergence} occurs \textbf{in both speakers}.
Lastly, lagged \emph{synchrony} can be observed between marks D and E.
If compared directly, the lagging might make the value changes look somewhat random.
However, looking at the entire segment, it's clear that the change is similar and is lead by the green speaker.
None of these mutual behavior can be captured by a \ac{did}-based approach.
For instance, comparing the beginning (mark A) and end (mark E) of the conversation would lead to the conclusion that there was no change in the values (illustrated by the corresponding dashed lines).
Similarly, splitting the conversation in two equal halves (A to D and D to E) would make it look like the changes were symmetrical, missing the obviously different behaviors of the speakers in these two halves.
Additionally, the directionality of the convergence between marks C and D will be missed by simple \ac{did} distance measures, which might give the impression that the changed rooted from only one of the speakers.
This could be satisfactory when it can be assumed that such changes can only occur in one speaker, like when talking with some computer-based interlocutor like a \ac{pa} (\cref{sec:convergence_to_natural_and_synthetic_stimuli,sec:vacc}, but not when both speakers' productions may be flexible, like in \ac{hhi} (\cref{sec:analysis_hhi}) or ultimately adaptive \acl{sds} (\cref{sec:adaptive_spoken_dialogue_systems}).
This limitation can be compensated to some extent by examining the \emph{relative} occurring changes \emph{gradually} (\cref{fig:condition_convergence_comparison,subsec:temporal_analysis}).

%Methods used in time series analysis are utilized in this paper to detect and model long-term relations within a conversation.
%This approach offers different types of analyses and emphasizes the temporal aspect of spoken interactions.
%The first is \ac{crqa}, which is proportionate to the conversation's length.
%It measures the \emph{mutual} similarity changes of the speakers throughout the entire conversation in term of recurrence.
%Additionally, it tells when the recurrence segments sustained for longer periods and which speaker lead them.
%\cref{sec:capturing_patterns_in_time_series} explains how this method is used to differentiate the dataset introduced in \cref{sec:dataset_and_feature_extraction} to define different profiles.
%Another method is neural autoencoder (\cref{subsec:dim_reduction}), which can learn non-linear representations in a latent space.
%This technique is good for creating generalized models based on many conversations and speakers.
%By using \ac{vae}, these models become generative and can therefore be used for producing varying speech output of a system fitting to its chosen profile or combination of profiles.
%Finally, \acp{gp} add stochastic Gaussian variability to the yielded output based on the function distribution derived from the models.
%Variations of the base behavior are produced that way.
%This is demonstrated in \cref{subsec:generation_gp_kriging}.

%As discussed in \cref{subsec:conversation-level_accommodation_behavior}, \ac{did} and sequential methods for measuring vocal changes (e.g., accommodation) rely on the chronological, turn-by-turn order of the interaction and their scope is limited to detect local phenomena only.
%Non-linear methods, contrarily, are not dependent on the chronological order of the interaction's turn and can therefore find long-term, more distant relations between the speakers with respect to the target feature.
%For instance, that an accommodation process (or generally closer values) occurred at some point in the beginning and continued at a later time, or that there was a periodic pattern of convergence and divergence throughout the interaction.
%Such phenomena point to more general, conversation-level properties that do not rely on the unfolding chronological order of the turns.
%This is especially useful for long interaction, where various patterns occur a more general view may be insightful (see example in \cref{fig:accommodation_types}).
%
%We take here a different view on the structure of the conversation, namely referring to it as a set of \emph{time series}.
%Time series is a sequence of chronologically ordered values sampled from some data stream along equal time intervals.
%Due to the way the dataset presented in \cref{sec:dataset_and_feature_extraction} is analyzed, the extracted features can be treated as couples of \emph{time series}, one for each speaker in each conversation.
%\todo{examples of where speech is treated as TS (ASR?)}
%Because of the nature of these features (and perhaps any spontaneous, interactive linguistic feature), the resulted time series can be assumed to be non-seasonal and non-stationary.
%\todo{might want to remove this sentence to not commit to this type of data}
%This view on the data enables a new assortment of analysis methods, from which \acf{crqa} and \acf{gp} are demonstrated here (\cref{subsec:crqa,subsec:generation_gp_kriging}).
%
%This recognition as time series opens new methodological possibilities for examining the evolution of these features and their realizations by different speakers in an interaction over time.
%Such methods include, among others, autocorrelation for examining serial dependency and forecasting for transferring information about the time series across time.
%Non-linear analysis methods for time series include, for example, noise reduction and non-linear prediction.
%We utilize here another method that uses phase-space embedding, which describes temporal evolution of trajectories of a dynamic system by projecting their embedding onto some common space.

\subsection{Terminology -- variation types}
\label{subsec:variation_types}

The term \enquote{convergence} is a central notion in this work.
This term's definition in this work is different from its meaning in other fields, like \ac{ml}.
Moreover, a wide range terms are used in the literature synonymously to describe the same phenomena, although there often subtle differences or emphases on specific angles of it.
Disambiguate these various terms should help avoiding confusion and allow more fine-grained description of such processes.
The core meaning of convergence is explained here in details, followed by a list of related terms and explanations about their use in the literature.

The verb \textit{to converge} is defined in Cambridge Dictionary\footnote{\url{http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/converge}} as moving toward, or merging into, the same point (e.g., roads).
A more non-materialistic definition is provided as well: \enquote{If ideas and opinions converge, they gradually become similar}.
Another, somewhat more general, definition to the noun \textit{convergence} is given in Merriam-Webster dictionary\footnote{\url{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/convergence}}: \enquote{the act of converging and especially moving toward union or uniformity}.
As all these definitions suggest, the core idea of this concept is two (or more) entities that change (potentially in different degrees) toward some physical or abstract point and ultimately meet.
In some time-dependent cases, like spoken interactions, this point can be expected to be withing the range of the entities (the speakers).
Further more, in such cases there might not be enough time for the them to meet, but to become closer, more similar, to one another nonetheless.
This matches the definition of \emph{phonetic convergence} proposed by \citet{Pardo2006phonetic}: \enquote{[\ldots] increase in segmental and suprasegmental similarities between two speakers}.
This also resembles the definition suggested by \citet{Xia2014prosodic}: \enquote{[\ldots] behaviors become more similar over time}, with \enquote{behaviors} referring to different modalities of communications in conversation, e.g., facial expressions, gestures, lexical choices, etc.
\review{make sure the direct quotes are accurate}
Other terms are sometimes used to describe similar processes or different aspects, and it is important to make the distinction between them.
Note that some of the terms are used interchangeably, as synonyms, or as hypernyms and hyponyms in other works.

The list presented here aims to unequivocally distinguish these terms and grant them useful relations to offer a meaningful common terminology, at the very least within the scope of this work and hopefully in the community of this research area in general.

\todo{create/find figures that describe (at least for some)?}
\todo{maybe create a table to compare all of them based on: mutual/one-sided, account for both increase and decrease, has a specific variation as a goal, what aspects is emphasizes (mutuality, initiating the effect, awared or not, capability, etc. maybe group the table by this text-based field and make the others yes/no (with V and X) columns) etc.}
\begin{description}
	\item[accommodation] -- often used as an overarching term, comes from accommodation theory (?). Includes any dynamic (or rather \emph{responsive}, see \putref{ref to accommodation levels}) changes during an interactions.
	Refers to both increase and decrease in similarity.
	
	\item[convergence] -- \ldots
	each speaker can account for a different \enquote{amount} of the convergence.
	it can also be symmetric (examples in Fig 1.1)
	(see illustration in Figure 1 in \citet{Levitan2011measuring})
	[after all sentence about convergence] Similarly, \textbf{divergence}\ldots
	
	\item[assimilation] -- implies a one-sided process, where one side changes in a certain way to match the other.
	It is seen more as a process that occurs as a result of a specific area/context.
	This term is typically used in Phonology to describe changes in pronunciation, e.g., when voiceness of a sound changes to match this of the sound adjacent to it.
	For more details and examples, see \citet[][pp.\ 89-98]{Hall2011phonologie}.
	Note that assimilation is only one of the phonological processes (others would be dissimilation, epenthesis, elision, and more), but since it's the once describing two things becoming more similar to each other, it is the one that might be used in this context.
	
	\item[entrainment] -- is presented by \citet{Brennan1996lexical} as the (potentially aware) influence of an interlocutor on another, e.g., to impose lexical units in an interaction, with emphasis on the on-sided nature of the effect.
	This means that one of the interlocutors established the use of an aforementioned term which created a bias by the conversation partner to employ it as well.
	The change is sometimes seen as categorical (similar to \textit{priming}), which is a key difference from the definition of convergence here.
	This is especially relevant in \ac{hci}, as it is much easier for a computer, due to the vocabulary problem \citep{Furnas1987vocabulary}, to establish such uses.
	\citet{Lopes2013automated} describes entrainment as imposed by a human speaker, where a computer-based interlocutor follows the lexical choices of the user.
	This term is sometimes also used a static measure of changes in an interaction (cf.\ \cref{subsec:limitations_of_did}), as in \citet{Levitan2013entrainment}.
	Conversely, \emph{convergence} is refereed here to the potentially mutual dynamic measure, the difference being comparing discrete timestamps in the interaction (for example, between two halves of a session, as done by \citet{Xia2014prosodic}) versus changes occurring gradually over its entire length.
	In addition to all the above, entrainment is often synonymous to convergence or accommodation in more technical fields.
	
	\item[priming] -- is similar to entrainment, but usually works on a larger scope -- both in terms of change and time.
	As oppose to entrainment, e.g., on the lexical level, priming can influence not just the use of one specific term, but a whole semantic field, and more in psycholinguistics contexts.
	For example, it was shown in experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{Meyer1971facilitation, Schvaneveldt1973retrieval} that people will response faster to words from a specific semantic field after being exposed to other words from it (i.e., different words that are semantically related).
	In more general terms, priming changes the likelihood of a person to use specific behavior, typically on some semantic or syntactic level.
	The temporal scope is different as well.
	Priming can have an effect in a longer term than a single interaction, ranging from multiple interactions, hours, days, and up to years.
	This is why priming is often referred to when talking about children \citep[see, e.g., ][]{Huttenlocher2004syntactic, Wansink2012would}.
	Like entrainment, priming also typically describe categorical change, as oppose to gradual change on a scale (see \textit{entrainment} above and cf.\ \citet{Reitter2006computational, Pace2013concept}).
	
	\item[adaptation] -- refers to the process of making intentional changes that suit certain conditions or situations.
	As such, this term stresses the ambition of these aware modifications in vocal behavior made by an interlocutor to be more similar to another, known and defined, target exhibited by another speaker.
	\citet{Kang2010emergence, Hwang2015phonetic} both examine phonetic adaptation process that occur gradually when encountering a new sound environment, to which speakers want or are expected to adapt.
	In these cases, the changes are also likely to be maintained outside the scope of a specific interaction.
	Adaptation is also used to describe the technical capability -- or more often the lack of one -- in a machine to match its speech production (typically to a user talking with the system).
	This fits the definition of adaptation being intentional and having a well-defined target to adapt towards.
	However, this is still a very limited feature due to the state of \ac{tts} technologies.
	The challenges and integration of such capabilities into \acp{sds} are discussed in \cref{sec:adaptive_spoken_dialogue_systems,chap:convergence_module_for_sdss}.
	
	\item[alignment] -- difference from assimilation? Maybe refers more to the time-aspect, that the interlocutors change in the same times, but not necessarily in the same way? Iona talk a bit about alignment in the introduction of the 2018 journal paper.
	specifically Interactive Alignment Model \citep{Pickering2004behavioral}
	
	\item[synchrony] -- refers to an ongoing process where the interlocutors are changing their behavior similarly, i.e., synchronously.
	Importantly, this applies for the relative change in each speaker, but not to any absolute values.
	That is, the distance is generally maintained while the individual ranges may differ (see Figure 1 in \citet{Levitan2011measuring}).
	When one of the speakers is leading the synchrony, it becomes \emph{lagged}, as shown in \cref{fig:accommodation_types}.
	Lagged phenomena are often identified, and their leader determined, using some correlation measure, like Perason's coefficient in \citet{Edlund2009pause, Xia2014prosodic}.
	A deeper analysis of such accommodation effect is presented in \cref{sec:analysis_hhi}.
	
	\item[mirroring] -- the potentially unaware cognitive effort to produce an output that follows some input.
	A.k.a.\ \enquote{mirrored equivalence} \citep{Messum2015creating, Messum2007mirroring}, this process differs from imitation by the lack of aim toward a well-defined target, but rather an internal representation of the similarity between the speakers.
	This may lead to a less planned and sometimes automatic effect of becoming closer to an interlocutor, where the specifications of the change do not necessarily match the input target.
	Less commonly, this term also refers to an effect opposite to synchrony, where the directions of the respective changes are reversed instead of similar (as if a mirror was put between them).
	Additionally, mirroring may also refer to an effect similar to mimicry, but with greater emphasis on speech learning and acquisition \citep[e.g.,][]{Yoshikawa2003constructivist}.
	
	\item[mimicry] -- is the tendency to behave, or speak, broadly like someone else.
	The emphasize here is on the \emph{general} inclination, which hints it can be done unintentionally, or, alternatively, be deliberate, but without the goal to perfectly match the target (as oppose to imitation).
	% inspired by https://www.voices.com/blog/mimicry_vs_imitation/
	\citet{Gueguen2009mimicry} demonstrate how mimicry can earn the mimicker more favorable judgment in social interactions.
	This is explained by mimicking creating greater feeling of affiliation and rapport in communication, or with the more positive evaluation of the mimicked person due to an enhanced familiarity established by the mimicker.
	\citet{Parrill2006seeing} show just how natural mimicry is in \ac{hhi} in an experiment where participants' behavior was affected merely by watching mimicking takes place in another conversation.
%	reference, mention \textit{Chameleon effect}\ldots
	
	\item[imitation] -- similar to mimicry, but is done awarely and with the goal to match as much closely as possible to a target.
	In addition, emphasizes the speaker's intent to completely match the auditory input \citep[cf.][]{Gueguen2009mimicry}.
	% inspired by https://www.voices.com/blog/mimicry_vs_imitation/
	The attempt to \emph{deliberately} repeat and \emph{accurately} replicate another speaker's productions distinguishes imitation from mirroring and mimicry.
	
	\item[chameleon effect] -- \citep{Chartrand1999chameleon}\\the very beginning of introduction of \citet{Gueguen2009mimicry} also have some good sentences
	
	\item[proximity] -- describes general closeness between interlocutors (as illustrated in Figure 1 in \citet{Levitan2011measuring}).
	This does not imply specific distance thresholds or absolute value ranges.
	Furthermore, this is a rather passive, potentially merely circumstantial, situation, which does not involve a vocal target or an aspiration to match it.
	The proximity at a specific point in time (typically around the start of a conversation) can be used as a reference point for other measures.
	
	\item[coordination] -- implies cooperation -- either seemingly or real -- between the interlocutors, i.e., that there is a common goal to achieve.
	Increase or decrease of communication features is in this case a side of effect of this coordination.
	This provides another point of view on the process, namely not to examine the speakers' collaboration based on common changes, but looking at the changes knowing they are collaborating.
	
	\item[inter-speaker influence] -- a general term to describe a change by a human interlocutor caused by another.

According to \citet{Pardo2006phonetic}, phonetic convergence is defined as an \emph{increase in segmental} \citep[e.g.,][]{Pardo2010conversational, Smith2007prosodic} \emph{and suprasegmental} \citep[e.g.,][]{Walker2015repeat, Shockley2004imitation} \emph{similarity between two interlocutors}.
In contrast to \emph{entrainment}, we use the term \emph{convergence} to describe dynamic, mutual, and non-imposing changes, with potentially non-polarized realizations.
Phonetic convergence has been found in both conversational \citep{Pardo2006phonetic, Lewandowski2012talent} and non-conversational \citep{Babel2014novelty, Shockley2004imitation} scenarios.
There is evidence for phonetic convergence being both an internal mechanism \citep{Pickering2004behavioral} and socially motivated \citep{Kim2011phonetic, Giles1991CAT}.
For instance, convergence \citep{Giles1973mobility} or divergence \citep{Bourhis1977distinctiveness} is triggered with decreasing or increasing social distance between interlocutors, respectively.
Experimental studies on several aspects of phonetic convergence, using a range of methods, have been carried out, e.g., by \citet{Pardo2013measuring, Nielsen2011specificity, Shockley2004imitation}.

Previous studies of phonetic convergence in spontaneous dyadic conversations have focused on speech rate \citep{Schweitzer2016exemplar} and timing-related phenomena \citep{Putman1984conception}, pitch \citep{Gessinger2018pitch, Schweitzer2017visibility}, intensity \citep{Levitan2011measuring, Natale1975convergence}, and perceived attractiveness \citep{Michalsky2017pitch}.
Phonetic convergence is often examined in the scope of shadowing experiments, in which the participants are asked to repeat utterances spoken by an interlocutor \citep{Pardo2017phonetic, Dias2016visibilivty, Walker2015repeat}.
This is typically done with single words as targets.
The experiment showcasing our system in \cref{sec:showcase} uses whole sentences as stimuli, in which the target features are embedded, making it a semi-conversational \ac{hci} setting.
