\subsection{Variation types}
\label{subsec:variation_types}

The term \enquote{convergence} is a key concept in this work.
To avoid confusion or ambiguous meaning from its use in other fields (like \ac{ml}), its relevant definition will be explained here, along with some other, related terms.
The verb \textit{to converge} is defined by Cambridge Dictionary\footnote{\url{http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/converge}} as moving toward, or merging into, the same point (e.g., roads).
A more non-materialistic definition is given as well: \enquote{If ideas and opinions converge, they gradually become similar}.
Another, somewhat more general, definition to the noun \textit{convergence} is given by Merriam-Webster dictionary\footnote{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/convergence}: \enquote{the act of converging and especially moving toward union or uniformity}.
As all these definitions suggest, the key idea of this concept is two (or more) entities that \textbf{both} change toward some point and ultimately meet.
In some time-dependent cases, like spoken interactions, there might not be enough time for the entities (the speakers) to meet.
In the scope of phonetic convergence, this still counts as convergence, based on the definition proposed by \citet{Pardo2006phonetic}: \enquote{[\ldots] increase in segmental and suprasegmental similarities between two speakers}.
This also resembles the definition suggested by \citet{Xia2014prosodic}: \enquote{[\ldots] behaviors become more similar over time} (where \enquote{behaviors} refers to different modalities of communications in conversation, e.g., facial expressions, gestures, lexical choices, etc.)

Other terms are sometimes used to describe similar processes, and it is important to make the distinction between those and convergence.
Note that some of the terms are used interchangeably or as synonyms or as hyper-~and~hyponyms in other works, and the distinctions made here, although pretend to unequivocally distinguish between them all, are designated for the scope of this work only.
\todo{find references for each of those}
\todo{create/find figures that describe (at least for some)}
\todo{maybe create a table to compare all of them based on: mutual/one-sided, account for both increase and decrease, has a specific variation as a goal, etc.}
\begin{description}
	\item[accommodation] a general term, comes from accommodation theory (?).
	Refers to both increase and decrease in similarity.
	
	\item[assimilation] implies a one-sided process, where one side changes in a certain way to match the other.
	It is seen more as a process that occurs as a result of a specific area/context.
	This term is typically used in Phonology to describe changes in pronunciation, e.g., when voiceness of a sound changes to match this of the sound adjacent to it.
	For more details and examples, see \cite[][chapter 3.3, pp. 89-98]{Hall2011phonologie}.
	Note that assimilation is only one of the phonological processes (others would be dissimilation, epenthesis, elision, and more), but since it's the once describing two things becoming more similar to each other, it is the one that might be used in this context.
	
	\item[entrainment] \citet{Brennan1996lexical} presents this terms as the (potentially unaware) decision of an interlocutor to start using the same terms as the other interlocutor. This means that one of the interlocutors established the use of the aforementioned term in the interaction.
	The change typically described as categorical (see also \textit{priming} below), which is a key difference from the definition of convergence here.
	This is especially relevant in \ac{hci}, as it is much easier for a computer, due to the vocabulary problem \citep{Furnas1987vocabulary}, to establish such uses.
	\citet{Lopes2013automated} also sees entrainment as something imposed by one side of the interaction, but this time the computer follows the lexical choices of the user.
	This term is sometimes also used a static measure of changes in an interaction. In this context, convergence is usually refereed to the parallel dynamic measure. The difference being comparing changes over the whole interaction or comparing changes in different temporal points in the interaction (For example, between two halves of a session, as done by \citet{Xia2014prosodic}).
	
	\item[priming] is similar to entrainment, but usually works on a larger scope -- both in terms of change and time.
	As oppose to entrainment, e.g., on the lexical level, priming can influence not just the use of one specific term, but a whole semantic field, and more in psycholinguistics contexts.
	For example, it was shown in experiments \cite[e.g.,][]{Meyer1971facilitation, Schvaneveldt1973retrieval} that people will response faster to words from a specific semantic field after being exposed to other words from it (i.e., different words that are semantically related).
	In more general terms, priming changes the likelihood of a person to use specific behavior, typically on some semantic or syntactic level.
	The temporal scope is different as well.
	Priming can have an effect in a longer term than a single interaction, ranging from multiple interactions, hours, days, and up to years.
	This is why priming is often referred to when talking about children \cite[see e.g.\ ][]{Huttenlocher2004syntactic, Wansink2012would}.
	Like entrainment, priming also typically describe categorical change, as oppose to gradual change on a scale (see \textit{entrainment} above and cf.\ \citet{Reitter2006computational} and \citet{Pace2013concept}).
	
	\item[adaptation] usually refers to the capability on the machine side (really only machine side?).
	also refers to a change that will last after the current conversation, e.g., like a user adaptation in \ac{tts}.
	
	\item[alignment] maybe like coordination? Maybe refers more to the time-aspect, that the interlocutors change in the same times, but not necessarily in the same way? Iona talk a bit about alignment in the introduction of the 2018 journal paper. specifically Interactive Alignment Model \citep{Pickering2004behavioral}
	
	\item[synchrony] measures how similar the values of the changes over time.
	However, the changes might be\ldots, i.e., the distance between the speakers does not reduce, but they move in synchrony in terms of absolute values.
	One of the interlocutors will be the ``leader'' of this process, after whom the synchronized changes will be triggered.
	Typically measured using Pearson's correlation coefficient (e.g., as in \citet{Edlund2009pause, Xia2014prosodic}).
	\todo[inline]{\citet{Levitan2011measuring} has a nice visual description for it.}
	
	\item[mimicry] difference from imitation from \url{https://www.voices.com/blog/mimicry_vs_imitation/} use here the \citet{Chartrand1999chameleon} and \citet{Gueguen2009mimicry} and maybe \citet{Parrill2006seeing} reference, mention \textit{Chameleon effect}\ldots
	
	\item[imitation] (also refer to mimicry, as they are similar)similar to mimickry, but is done awarely, where the speaker's goal is to appear as similar as possible to the imitated interlocutor.
	
	\item[mirroring] potentially an aware act. the changes themselves are not planned, but rather automatic to match the target as closely as possible, without considering the output (like an actual mirror).
	
	\item[chameleon effect] \citep{Chartrand1999chameleon}
	
	\item[proximity] indicates how close are the interlocutors to each other as a starting point with respect to their normal behavior.
	For example, their normal f0 compared to their f0 at the beginning of a specific conversation between these two interlocutors.
	This measurement refers only to the beginning of the interaction and serves as a reference point for a specific interaction.
	\todo[inline]{\citet{Levitan2011measuring} has a nice visual description for it.}
	
	\item[coordination] implies cooperation between the interlocutors, i.e. that there is a common goal to achieve.
	Increase or decrease of communication features is in this case a side of effect of this coordination.
	This provides another point of view on the process, namely not to examine the speakers' collaboration based on common changes, but looking at the changes knowing they are collaborating.
	
	\item[inter-speaker influence] a general term to describe a change by a human interlocutor caused by another.
	
	\item[convergence] \ldots

According to \citet{Pardo2006phonetic}, phonetic convergence is defined as an \emph{increase in segmental} \citep[e.g.,][]{Pardo2010conversational, Smith2007prosodic} \emph{and suprasegmental} \citep[e.g.,][]{Walker2015repeat, Shockley2004imitation} \emph{similarity between two interlocutors}.
In contrast to \emph{entrainment}, we use the term \emph{convergence} to describe dynamic, mutual, and non-imposing changes, with potentially non-polarized realizations.
Phonetic convergence has been found in both conversational \citep{Pardo2006phonetic, Lewandowski2012talent} and non-conversational \citep{Babel2014novelty, Shockley2004imitation} scenarios.
There is evidence for phonetic convergence being both an internal mechanism \citep{Pickering2004behavioral} and socially motivated \citep{Kim2011phonetic, Giles1991CAT}.
For instance, convergence \citep{Giles1973mobility} or divergence \citep{Bourhis1977distinctiveness} is triggered with decreasing or increasing social distance between interlocutors, respectively.
Experimental studies on several aspects of phonetic convergence, using a range of methods, have been carried out, e.g., by \citet{Pardo2013measuring, Nielsen2011specificity, Shockley2004imitation}.

Previous studies of phonetic convergence in spontaneous dyadic conversations have focused on speech rate \citep{Schweitzer2016exemplar} and timing-related phenomena \citep{Putman1984conception}, pitch \citep{Gessinger2018pitch, Schweitzer2017visibility}, intensity \citep{Levitan2011measuring, Natale1975convergence}, and perceived attractiveness \citep{Michalsky2017pitch}.
Phonetic convergence is often examined in the scope of shadowing experiments, in which the participants are asked to repeat utterances spoken by an interlocutor \citep{Pardo2017phonetic, Dias2016visibilivty, Walker2015repeat}.
This is typically done with single words as targets.
The experiment showcasing our system in \cref{sec:showcase} uses whole sentences as stimuli, in which the target features are embedded, making it a semi-conversational \ac{hci} setting.
